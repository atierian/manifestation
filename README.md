# manifestation

## Overview
manifestation is a command line tool that parses the content of a Swift Package manifest (Package.swift file) and generates a report based on it.

## Installation
`git clone https://github.com/atierian/manifestation.git` or use SSH if you're so inclined.

`cd manifestation`

Then decide if you want to install this globally or not. If so, you'll run:

`swift build --configuration release`

`cp -f .build/release/manifestation /usr/local/bin/manifestation`

If you don't want to, you'll just need to prefix the commands listed below with `swift run`
e.g.

`swift run manifestation ~/Projects/FooKit --dump`


```
OVERVIEW: Parse a Package.swift manifest.

USAGE: manifestation <path> [--dump]

ARGUMENTS:
  <path>                  The path to the Package.swift.

OPTIONS:
  -d, --dump              Dump the entire package manifest
  -h, --help              Show help information.
```

## Usage
Provide the **absolute** path to the directory containing your `Package.swift`.
For example, if you have a `Package.swift` here `/Users/Foo/Projects/FooKit/Package.swift`, you would run:

`manifestation /Users/Foo/Projects/FooKit` or `manifestation ~/Projects/FooKit`

Here's the output from the `Package.swift` of `manifestation` as an example:

Using the flag `--dump` with dump the entire `Manifest` object into your console, providing a lot of detail.

You might be asking why the hell the entirety of swift-package-manager is included in this repo. SPM pins its dependency on Swift Argument Parser to a version previous to argument parser's addition of `AsyncParsableCommand`. Since I was too lazy to use `CommandLine` APIs to make this, I just pulled in swift-package-manager locally, changed it to depend on the `main` branch of Swift Argument Parser, and it worked ðŸ¤·.
